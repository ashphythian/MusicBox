# MusicBox

This project is in its infancy, and features will slowly be added.

## Current Features

Build a scale from a root and major/minor mode (more will be added).
```
ScaleBuilder.build('C', 'Maj') # => ["C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "A", "B", "C"]
```

## TODOs
### Small:
* Make scales diatonic

### Big:
* Add a scale finder
* Add a chord finder
* Add an audio converter
* Add some MIDI generators
